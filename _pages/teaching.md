I regard the opportunity to teach, mentor, and interact with students as the utmost privilege. As a statistician and data science educator, my teaching philosophy is to empower my students so that they can approach their pursuit of statistics with curiosity and confidence. Furthermore, I strive to reduce barriers to statistics and data science, especially for students from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds (e.g., race and ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and previous background in mathematics).

Below is a selected list of my teaching and mentoring experiences:

## Stanford University

- [Optimizing Culturally Inclusive Mentoring Practices](https://postdocs.stanford.edu/events/optimizing-culturally-inclusive-mentoring-practices)

## University of Washington

I have served as a Teaching Assistant for the following courses and have won an Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award in the School of Public Health at the University of Washington:
