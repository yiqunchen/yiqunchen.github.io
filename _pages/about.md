I am Yiqun Chen (pronunciation [here](./document/yiqunchen_name_recording.mp3)), currently a [Data Science Postdoctoral Fellow](https://datascience.stanford.edu/programs/data-science-fellows) at Stanford University, working with Professor [James Zou](https://www.james-zou.com/) on applying advanced AI techniques to biomedical data. Previously, I completed my PhD in Biostatistics under the guidance of Professor [Daniela Witten](https://www.danielawitten.com/) at the University of Washington, where I developed methods to test data-driven hypotheses. My application interest spans different fields of data science: from dermatology, social networks and epidemiology, as well as HCI and microbiome science.

Before graduate school, I earned undergraduate degrees in Statistics, Computer Science, and Chemical Biology with high distinction from the University of California, Berkeley. I've also gained industry experience in data science with Amazon Search and Waymo LLC. 

I am always excited to explore collaboration opportunities, participate in reviews, and deliver talks. Please feel free to reach out to me via email at **yiqun.t.chen[at]gmail[dot]com** or schedule a [meeting](https://calendly.com/yiqunchen) with me.
